Middlebury Cycling

The online home of Middlebury College's Cycling Team.

This website was designed and is maintained by [Nate Beatty](http://natebeatty.com). It is funded privately and the contents of the site do not in any way represent the official views of Middlebury College.

Site Development
---

This site uses [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to compile static pages which are then interpreted by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which generates the final site. The website is hosted online by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), making it easy to change the content anytime. It sounds like an unnecessarily complicated production, but makes changes easy to make once the site is set up. The tools we use on this site are listed below:

* Gumby CSS Framework
* NodeJS
* Grunt
* Jekyll
* Git / Github Pages
