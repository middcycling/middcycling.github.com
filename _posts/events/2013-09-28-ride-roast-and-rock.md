The annual Ride, Roast, and Rock, a benefit for the local teen center, takes place on Saturday. There are three ride options:

* 59-mile Double Gap (check-in 7:30, start at 8)
* 26-mile Little City (check-in 10:30, start at 11)
* 8-mile Morgan Horse Farm (check-in 11:30, start at 12)

Students get a discount on entry (10 bucks!) and there is a pig roast after the ride on the Town Green. Trust me, the pulled pork sandwich after the ride is seriously worth it. Saturday's weather is looking beautiful, so you should do this if you can!
