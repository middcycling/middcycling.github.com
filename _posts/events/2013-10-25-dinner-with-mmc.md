What is better than a dinner shared with folks who love the outdoors? On Friday, October 26, we will be joining forces with the [Middlebury Mountain Club]() to host a social gathering for folks who love long rides, spectacular views, tough climbs, steep descents, high peaks, low valleys, winding rivers, rocky trails, dense forests, and falling leaves. Join us at Brooker at 7:00p for a home cooked meal and a chance to meet other bicycle and outdoor enthusiasts! Exchange contact info, organize rides, and [get pumped]() for [Circumburke](), which takes place two days later.
