Last week, we held the first group Trail Tuesday of the fall. It was a classic Autumn VT trail ride with leaves, dirt, uphill, downhill, rocks, roots, and a flowy final run down Rehab (the best run on Chipman Hill). We were out for just over an hour - it was a great study break!

Join us again on Tuesday for another trail ride. We're going to do pretty much the same loop as last time, exploring Battell Woods, Means Woods, and a run up (and down!) Chipman Hill. As always, show up at ADK at 4:30 with your mountain bike and get psyched to go play in the woods. All riders and all abilities welcome!
