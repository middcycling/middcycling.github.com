This Sunday, join the club for a casual group ride. There are posters around campus that say Saturday, but ignore them! We will meet at Adirondack Circle at 2 PM and ride up to Vergennes and back (roughly 20 miles). We will stop at [The Laundry](http://www.vergenneslaundry.com/index.html) for coffee, so bring a few bucks! The pace will be easy; it's a leisurely "recovery ride" after Saturday night...
