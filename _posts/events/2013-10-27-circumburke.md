We had so much fun at Circumburke last year that we're headed over there in 2013 to once again take on the challenges that only the trails at Burke Mountain can present!

Circumburke is not quite a ride and not quite a race. It is an awesome, fully supported ride that includes miles of the best singletrack that the Northeast Kingdom has to offer. Learn more about the race [here](http://circumburke.org). We are still in the process of making transportation plans and registering, but we will be sure to keep you posted as things solidify.
