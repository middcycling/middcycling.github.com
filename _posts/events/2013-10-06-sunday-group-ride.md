[Last week](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200677618842931&set=o.107748225925892&type=3&theater), we had a blast riding to the [Vergennes Laundry](http://www.vergenneslaundry.com/index.html) on a chill Sunday group ride! There was a good turnout, the ride was spectacular, and the coffee was deliciously French.

In fact, we had so much fun that we want to make the Sunday ride a weekly event! Join us again on Sunday, Oct. 6th at 10:00am. We'll leave from Adirondack Circle and do another destination. It will be 20-30 miles and will probably include a stop for coffee, so bring a few bucks. All abilities welcome! Bring a friend - the more the merrier.
