In the spirit of reviving last year's group rides, we will be riding mountain bikes every Tuesday afternoon for the rest of the fall! Bring your mountain bike and a friend to ADK circle at 4:30pm on Tuesday evening. Depending on the trail conditions, we'll ride the best trails that Battell and Means Woods and Chipman Hill have to offer.

The terrain is technical, but there are ridearounds for some of the tricky parts and we'll stop at all of the intersections. This will be a good ride to discover new trails and is suitable for all abilities! We can't wait to show you the best trails, no matter your skill level, that are right in our backyard.
