As long as I have been at Middlebury, there have been rumors on the team about our history. Past leadership pronounced Middlebury Cycling the oldest organized athletic team at Middlebury College. There have also been shouts, not whisperings, that the club has produced more professional athletes than any other team. With notable alumni [Megan Guarnier](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Megan-Guarnier/323989234330880), [Ted King](http://www.iamtedking.com), [Lea Davison](http://iamspecialized.com/xc-mtb/rider/lea-davison), and [Macky Franklin](http://www.mackyfranklin.com), our riders have certainly had a respectable share of pro spots in the world of cycling recently. That being said, I am still unsure about the claimed statistic about our quantity of professional athlete alums in comparison with the other teams. In regards to the other rumor, Middlebury Cycling's Mike Gaskin '11 has done his research and has confirmed its validity. In a post to the team facebook page, Mike writes:

<blockquote>
I'm ready to call it: Cycling is the first and oldest uniformed team sport at Middlebury. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The Middlebury Undergraduate reported in October 1883 that general interest in athletics was increasing, but the activities were still informal. It reads "Bicycling is very common, with five handsome bicycles already upon the campus. Baseball seems to lag just at present, but by a little practice, a fair club might be formed. Now that it is late in the season, probably not much will be done in that line before the spring term."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Then, in April 1884, the Undergraduate reported that "The bicycling club is in a flourishing condition. It is composed the following members: Prof. Eaton, Samuel Sheldon, MacGowan, Bailey, Dana, and Fletcher. With new suits they make a pretty appearance when together on the streets."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
So that proves that they were organized and had uniforms. Meanwhile, Henry Lincoln Bailey '1886 recalled in the Middlebury College News Letter of September 1929 that "Forty five years ago, there was not a tennis racket nor a football upon the campus...tennis arrived the next year, 1885, and there was a feeble and futile attempt to start football."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Even if baseball started a uniformed team in spring of 1884, that would tie it, at best, with cycling for the honor of Middlebury's first uniformed sports team. And so far I haven't seen any proof that they did.

Here's to the upcoming 130th anniversary of Middlebury Cycling!

So thank you, Mr. Gaskin, for your hard work and research. I am proud to be a part of such of a longstanding Middlebury tradition and I hope that it will continue in fine form for years to come.

Cheers. In the words of Macky Franklin: Bikes are awesome!
