This past weekend, a few Middlebury Cyclists participated in the <em>Ride, Roast, and Rock</em> to bennefit the local <a href="http://addisonteens.com">Addison Central Teens</a> (<a href="http://addisonteens.com">A.C.T.</a>) organization. Rides included 8, 26, and <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/23505788">46 mile loops</a>. Although the long ride was abbreviated from a 2-gap 52 mile epic due to rainy and cold weather, the turnout was great and the riders returned smiling.

After the ride, the cyclists had a pig roast on the town green with live music in the gazebo. Props to everyone who braved the elements to support the youth in the Middlebury community!
