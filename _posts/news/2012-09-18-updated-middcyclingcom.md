Welcome to the new middcycling.com! We are pleased to have a simplified website to help us spread the word about cycling at Middlebury College and in the greater Middlebury community.

This site is meant to provide information about group rides, races, past results, and how to get involved in the cycling community.

The best way to hear about group rides and events is to follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/middcycling) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/middcycling) and to subscribe to our mailing list by firing an email off to [subscriptions@middcycling.com](mailto:subscriptions@middcycling.com) with the word "subscribe" in the subject.

If you are looking for a good ride, check out our Strava page and become a member of the club on Strava. It's free to sign up and it's an awesome way to see what rides we have been doing over the past couple of months. All of the rides in this part of Vermont are awesome and looking at our recent rides will give you a good place to start. You can always send an email to [cycling@middlebury.edu](cycling@middlebury.edu) or check out the facebook page for a suggestion!

This website is still evolving and will be updated as we have time over the next couple of weeks. We welcome any suggestions and feedback that you may have as we try to improve our online presence and build more useful online tools.
