Let the racing begin! The 2013 ECCC Road season is finally here. Last weekend found four members of the Middlebury Cycling Club in New Jersey, at the campus of Rutgers University, for a three-race, two-day omnium for the season opener. It was a great weekend, with some solid results from each racer.

After complications with van reservations, we nearly had to skip the entire event, but Miriam Nielsen saved the day with her 15-person license. We arrived at the house of alum Alex Abarbanel-Grossman late on Friday night, and crashed in his living room, hoping to get a few winks before Saturday’s early start. 
The first event was the Individual Time Trial, early Saturday morning, in Somerset, New Jersey. The course was short, only 2.2 miles out-and-back, but a great way to start the season. Spencer Egan (2015.5) went off first of the team, and laid down a smoking time to finish ninth in the Men’s Intro. Miriam (2014), despite racing on a nearly flat tire, ended up 16th in the Women’s Intro. Zack Isaacs (2015.5) flew to tenth place in Men’s B, and Jake Barker (2016) narrowly missed the victory in Men’s C2.

Later that day, we relocated to Rutgers campus in Jamesburg for the criterium. It featured a great course, with four corners, about 0.8 miles in length. It was an exciting day for Middlebury Cycling. In Men’s C2, Jake ate up the second prime (a mid-race sprint for a time bonus) about halfway into the 30 minute race and broke away with two other racers. He then edged out Jacob Lapenna, of Princeton, by a wheel length for the win. In his first true bike race, Spencer had a strong finish in eighth place, while Miriam was only 22 seconds off the pace to finish 11th in Women’s Intro. Zack had his best collegiate result, crushing the final sprint to finish third in Men’s B.

The success continued on Sunday for the circuit race, where we raced on last year’s crit course, a fantastic hilly, cornerless lap in Piscataway, New Jersey. Jake took control of the Men’s C2 race early on, edging the pace and watching for attacks. He was outsprinted at the end by a MIT rider (maybe the wind tunnel worked?) to finish strong in second place. Spencer rode with the lead group of Men’s Intro the entire race, coming in third place in the end, and Miriam continued her consistent finishes in Women’s Intro, placing ninth. Zack rode another fantastic race, and after leading the final descent into the finish, he crossed the line in fifth place.

In points standings, Zack is sitting fourth overall with 64 points in Men’s B, and Jake is dominating Men’s C with 81 points. Spencer and Miriam are in fifth and thirteenth, respectively.

Big shout out to the Abarbanel-Grossman family for housing us this past weekend. You guys rock! This coming Friday, we are heading to New York City for the World-Famous Grant’s Tomb Criterium, followed by a circuit race in New Jersey.
