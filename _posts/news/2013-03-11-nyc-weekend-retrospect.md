Another successful weekend of bike racing! Week two of the 2013 ECCC season took the Middlebury team down to the bustling metropolis of New York City (almost like our little collegiate town we call home) and back to New Jersey. The A-Team returned from last weekend; Zach, Spencer, Miriam and I hopped in a van after class on Friday and moseyed south to the Big Apple. The always-gracious Abarbanel-Grossman family was kind enough to extend their home to us once again. Thank you so much! There had been another winter storm in the city and surrounding area, and luckily the race was not canceled, thanks to the superb planning and hard work of the volunteers at the races this weekend.

Saturday morning was an early start, and we even carpooled with the world-famous Alex “Griz” Grossman to the race venue at Grant’s Tomb. Racing in such an urban area is quite surreal. Zach and I decided to race in the Open Category 4 race on Friday as well, which started around 8 am. The field was absolutely gargantuan with about 80 riders. Zach probably would have won, but one lap in, his saddle decided to partially detach. After the SRAM guys fixed it, he wasn’t given a free lap (given to riders who crash or experience a technical problem with their bicycle), so he rode valiantly hoping to catch up, but he was already a lap behind, and was asked to pull out. I stayed in the mix and finished 14th. Alex rode in the ruthlessly competitive Pro/1/2 crit, and unfortunately had to pull out early. It was awesome to see the experienced alum take a few turns with the big boys.

In the Men’s D2 race, Spencer controlled nearly the entire 9.9-mile race, and finished solidly in 11th place. Miriam rode ferociously in Women’s Intro to finish in sixth place, a mere six seconds behind the winner. Zach and I both raced in Men’s B this weekend, unfortunately not wearing matching Midd kits, but we had good finishes in our second crit of the day. Ol’ Matthew LloydThomas, of Yale, put the hammer down in our race for the win after attempting a solo breakaway for half the race. Zach and I finished with the pack, crossing the line 12th and 17th, respectively. Zach had his GoPro rolling for the entirety of the race, and got some radical footage from the racer’s perspective (hopefully we can get it up on the website at some point).

After paying an absurd toll to get into the city, we decided to meander NYC for a few hours after the races. We met up with family and friends, congregating at a café near the race venue, and had an interesting interaction with a Puerto Rican and his pet parrot, Coco. 	

On Sunday, after being brutally attacked by Daylight Savings, we managed to get to the circuit race on the Watchung Reservation near Mountainside, New Jersey. The 6.3 mile course combined almost every aspect of road riding; it had technical descents, steep climbs, and sections of road that could’ve been used in a cyclo-cross race. Spencer had a fantastic early morning race in the D’s three lap event, racing very competitively to finish 6th. Miriam was strong and consistent in Women’s Intro, finishing 3rd. In the 31-mile Men’s B race, Zach rode like lion. If he wasn’t leading, he was in the top 5, constantly vying for the top position and following each counterattack, and ended up finishing 16th. I, on the other hand, had to hang on for dear life, and managed to finish with the lead group, in 21st. It was the first longer road race of the season, and it was definitely not an easy one.

We continued our tradition of a post-race Chipotle refuel, before heading home. The drive back was smooth, and we got back on campus in time to make a late Proctor run. Somehow, the van was cleaned (thanks, Spencer!), and I don’t think we had to stay up too late to finish work (2:30 is reasonable, right?). 

Another fantastic weekend, with good food, great people, and unbelievable bike racing! We have a few weeks off, and then we’ll be heading to Worcester, Massachusetts, at the end of March for the MIT race.

Happy spring, and we hope to see you out and about on two wheels!
