We at the Middlebury Cycling Club are thrilled to announce our new partnership with [Vermont Peanut Butter](http://www.vtpeanutbutter.com)! Based in Morrisville, Vermont (just a bit north of Stowe), VTPB is a 100% locally-run operation with an emphasis on supporting athletes. And Chris Kaiser, founder, President, and CEO, is an avid mountain biker to boot! From our perspective, we love to patronize Vermont businesses at least as much as we love peanut butter, so it’s hard to imagine a better fit. 

Our relationship with Chris and VTPB began this summer when club member Alex Abarbanel-Grossman and Midd Cycling alum and entrepreneur Alex Bea sat down to discuss how the club might be able to get its name out into the Vermont community. Alex A-G, who was already familiar with VTPB products like Green Mountain Goodness, threw out the idea of getting in contact with Chris. Alex Bea took the initiative, and within a week had worked out an agreement. We got a whole lot of peanut butter, and Chris got the VTPB name on our forthcoming jersey redesign, as well as product exposure to those in our club and our network of contacts. A total win-win stituation!

A few weeks ago Midd Cycling President Nate Beatty drove up to Morrisville with Alex A-G to pick up the goods. After emailing back and forth with Chris, it was great to finally meet him and see the place where the magic happens. 

Now that we have our peanut butter, though, it’s time to use it--and that’s where you can help! We’ve already given away six of the twelve jars from the initial batch to club members, and used a couple more at the CircumBurke mountain bike race, but there are still a few left. Have any recipes for bars or some other ideas about how the club could use its peanut butter? If so, send them over to us at cycling@middlebury.edu.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates about peanut butter and/or general club business. And finally, another huge thank-you to Chris and the rest of the crew over at VTPB--we’re really excited to be working with you guys and we can’t wait to make the most of our relationship!
